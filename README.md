## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abirxdhack/RedditDLBot.git
cd RedditDLBot
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Use `pip` to install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure the Bot
Create a `config.py` file and add the following variables:
```python
API_ID = "your-api-id"
API_HASH = "your-api-hash"
BOT_TOKEN = "your-bot-token"
COMMAND_PREFIX = ["/", ".", "!", ","]
```

## Usage

### Start the Bot
Run the bot using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Commands
- `/start`: Displays the welcome message with helpful links.
- `/red [Reddit URL]`: Downloads media from the given Reddit URL.

Example:
```bash
/red https://reddit.com/r/example_post
```

## How it Works

1. The bot listens for the `/red` command along with a Reddit URL.
2. It fetches media metadata and available quality options via the BDBOTS API.
3. The user selects the desired quality through inline buttons.
4. The bot downloads the media, shows real-time progress, and uploads the media to Telegram.
